Algorithm:

allocate memory for deck and populate it
shuffle deck 1000 times
deal cards (one at a time) to players, malloc for each card owned by a player
display player's hand
check if any cards in player hand match first card, reprat for all cards in hand
if matching cards are found, remove them from hand list
repeat above steps for computer's hand
pick a player to go first, let them pick a card at random from opponent's hand
remove that card from opponent's hand, add it to player's hand
check for pairs, remove if any are found
repeat for computer, card will be picked randomly
players take turns until only one card is left in both hands (will be the queen of hearts), that player loses
prompt player to play again?
