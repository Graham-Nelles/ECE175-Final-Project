				TO DO:
FIX NOW:
2: Validate node_remove function
3: Implement node_transfer function
	currently blocked by 2
-----
ANTICIPATED PROBLEMS:
4: Deck list is calloc'ed
	this could cause issues later when cards need to be removed from deck
	might be able to get around this by realloc'ing deck memory whenever cards are removed from the list
	possible fix: malloc memory for each card in create_decklist (malloc in loop after moving pointer for next card?) instead of calloc'ing all at once
		this may not work due to needing to move pointers through deck memory to create all cards: malloc'ed memory might not behave in the same way (if it is not allocated contiguously)

NICE-TO-HAVE:
Function to check if a list properly terminates (loop detection)
